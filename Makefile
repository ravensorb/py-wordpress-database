# outside it -- act has no OIDC and ignores job.permissions, so running them
# locally would be misleading at best, and release.yml CREATES TAGS and dispatches
# publishes, which must never happen from a laptop.
#
# A dry run is the middle ground and it is worth more than it looks. act resolves
# every `uses:` ref against the remote before deciding to skip the step, so a
# dryrun fails on an action version that does not exist -- it is what catches
# `changelog-parser@v3.0.14`, a real version of a DIFFERENT action, which no
# amount of YAML validation would have found. It also catches expression syntax
# errors, unknown contexts and missing `needs`.
#
# --dryrun IS LOAD-BEARING, not a nicety. Without it this target cuts real tags
# and fires real publishes. A contract test asserts every workflow named here is
# run with it, so removing it fails `make check` rather than surprising someone.

# ci.yml is NOT dry-run: `make ci` runs it for real, and act SEGFAULTS dry-running
