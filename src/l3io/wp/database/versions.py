"""Interpreting WordPress's ``db_version``.

WordPress stores a schema revision in its options table. The original package
mapped it to a release number with a hand-maintained dictionary that stopped at
WordPress 5.5.1 -- so by the time this rewrite began it returned ``None`` for
*every* WordPress from 5.6 onward. It had quietly stopped working rather than
merely aged, which is the failure mode a hand-kept table invites.

The map is now derived from the source of truth and committed as generated
data, so the runtime needs no network. See ``tools/generate_version_map.py``;
regenerating is a maintenance task, not a deployment step.

Two properties worth stating:

* **The floor is WordPress 5.0**, which is a support decision rather than a
  limit of the derivation -- ``$wp_db_version`` is readable back to 2.0 if the
  floor ever needs lowering. Every one of the 328 releases at or above 5.0
  yields a value, so the map has no gaps within its supported range. Anything
  below the floor reports ``None`` and is distinguishable via
  :attr:`WpDatabaseVersion.is_older_than_supported`.
* **The mapping is many-to-one.** Several releases share a ``db_version``
  (7.0 and 7.1 both report 61833), so a value identifies the release that
  *introduced* that schema, not the exact release installed.
