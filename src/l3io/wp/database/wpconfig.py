"""Read connection details out of a WordPress ``wp-config.php``.

An adapter over ``l3io-wp-config``, which lives behind the ``wpconfig`` extra.
Per AD-1 the adapter *holds* the config object and exposes only what this
package needs, rather than subclassing it -- subclassing would make every
method of the underlying type public here automatically, so the declared
surface would leak by construction and ``__all__`` could not bound it.

Three properties of the upstream API matter enough to state:

* An absent key returns a ``MISSING`` sentinel, not ``None``. ``MISSING`` is
  falsy, so ``if config.get("DB_PASSWORD"):`` cannot distinguish "not defined"
  from a legitimately empty value. Every read here tests ``is MISSING``.
* PHP types are preserved, so ``define('DB_PORT', 3306)`` is an ``int`` while
  ``define('DB_PASSWORD', '3306')`` stays a ``str``. Values are coerced
  deliberately rather than assumed to be strings.
* ``$table_prefix`` is a PHP *variable*, not a ``define()``, and lives in a
  separate namespace: ``get_variable("table_prefix")``. ``get("table_prefix")``
  correctly returns ``MISSING``.
