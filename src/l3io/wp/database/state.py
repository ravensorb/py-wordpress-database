"""Outcomes of inspecting a database's state.

The original package answered "does this database exist?" with a bare boolean
produced by a method that caught every exception and returned ``False``. That
made "absent", "wrong password" and "host unreachable" indistinguishable -- and
since the caller's next move is to create objects using *administrative*
credentials, collapsing those cases is the dangerous part, not a cosmetic one.
