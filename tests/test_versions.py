"""The db_version lookup, and the derived map it reads.

The original held this as a hand-maintained dict of string keys that stopped at
WordPress 5.5.1, so it returned None for every WordPress from 5.6 onward. These
tests pin both halves of the fix: the data is derived, and the lookup is
numeric and ordered.
