"""Assert no development source reached the built distributions' metadata.

Scope, deliberately narrow and stated so this cannot be mistaken for the
stronger claim: this checks the *resolved dependency metadata* of the wheel and
the sdist. It does NOT assert that the sdist's own ``pyproject.toml`` is free of
``[tool.uv]`` configuration -- it is not, and that is inert because uv honours
sources and required-version for the project being developed rather than for a
dependency built from an sdist, and pip ignores the table entirely. See
ADR-0007, which splits those two claims.

Why it inspects ``Requires-Dist`` lines specifically, and must keep doing so: a
search for a hostname over the whole file reports a leak on a completely clean
artifact. ``Project-URL`` entries and the README carried in the long description
both legitimately contain ``github.com``. A check that cries wolf gets switched
off, so do not "simplify" this into a grep.
